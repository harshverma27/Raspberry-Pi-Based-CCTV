# MotionEye CSI Camera Fix using v4l2loopback + FFmpeg

This repository documents how to use a **Raspberry Pi CSI camera (v1.3 / OV5647)** with **MotionEye** on **Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye (32-bit)** by bridging the camera output to a **v4l2loopback dummy device**.

MotionEye often fails to show CSI camera video because it expects a **V4L2 camera device**, while Raspberry Pi CSI cameras are handled differently by the kernel and camera stack. This setup works around that limitation cleanly and reliably.

---

## 🧩 Problem

- MotionEye does **not display CSI camera video**
- Camera appears as `vc.ril.camera`
- `/dev/video0` exists but MotionEye cannot use it directly
- Selecting MMAL or V4L2 shows no video
- MotionEye requires a standard **V4L2-compatible device**

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

We solve this by:
1. Creating a **dummy V4L2 camera** using `v4l2loopback`
2. Using **FFmpeg** to forward the real CSI camera (`/dev/video0`) into the dummy device (`/dev/video1`)
3. Running everything automatically at **system boot** using systemd services
4. Configuring MotionEye to use `/dev/video1`

## 🛠 Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (Zero / Zero 2 / 3 / 4)
- CSI Camera (OV5647 / v1.3)
- Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye (32-bit)
- MotionEye installed
- Required packages:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg v4l2loopback-dkms v4l-utils
````

## 📷 Camera Devices

| Device        | Description                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `/dev/video0` | Real CSI camera                      |
| `DummyCam`    | Dummy camera created by v4l2loopback |

## 🔧 Systemd Services

### 1️⃣ v4l2loopback.service

Creates the dummy V4L2 camera at boot.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Load v4l2loopback dummy camera
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/sbin/modprobe v4l2loopback video_nr=1 card_label=DummyCam exclusive_caps=1
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**What this service does:**

* Loads the `v4l2loopback` kernel module
* Creates `/dev/video1`
* Labels it as `DummyCam`
* Runs once at boot

---

### 2️⃣ ffmpeg-bridge.service

Bridges the real CSI camera to the dummy camera.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=FFmpeg bridge from /dev/video0 to /dev/video1
After=v4l2loopback.service
Requires=v4l2loopback.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -r 30 -f v4l2 /dev/video1
Restart=always
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
### 3️⃣ An All in one Python File
The python file does the work of both the service files in one go, it converts the csi input to v4l2, while the python file in running only. 

Libraries Required:
```
sudo apt install -y python3-dev python3-setuptools python3-wheel build-essential libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libpng-dev libfreetype6-dev libopenjp2-7-dev libtiff-dev libwebp-dev
```    
One thing you need to remember, is to create a Empty Video Device before running the file.

```
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback \ devices=1 \ video_nr=40 \ card_label="DummyCam" \ exclusive_caps=1
```

```
sudo python3 csi_to_v4l2.py
```

**What this service does:**

* Reads video from `/dev/video0`
* Converts it into a standard V4L2 stream
* Forwards it to `/dev/video1`
* Forces **30 FPS**
* Automatically restarts on failure

---

## 🚀 Enable & Start Services

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable v4l2loopback.service
sudo systemctl enable ffmpeg-bridge.service
sudo systemctl start v4l2loopback.service
sudo systemctl start ffmpeg-bridge.service
```

After reboot, both services will start automatically.

---

## 🎥 MotionEye Configuration

1. Open MotionEye Web UI
2. Add **Local V4L2 Camera**
3. Set:

   * **Camera Device:** `/dev/video1`
   * **Camera Name:** DummyCam
4. Save

🎉 MotionEye will now show the CSI camera feed correctly.

---

## 🧪 Debugging

List video devices:

```bash
ls /dev/video*
```

List camera formats:

```bash
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
```

View FFmpeg logs:

```bash
journalctl -u ffmpeg-bridge.service -f
```

Check service status:

```bash
systemctl status v4l2loopback.service
systemctl status ffmpeg-bridge.service
```

---

## ✅ Result

* CSI camera works reliably with MotionEye
* Stable **30 FPS**
* No `device busy` errors
* Fully automatic on boot
* Works on low-power boards like Raspberry Pi Zero
